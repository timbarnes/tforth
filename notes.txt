Compile mode implementation
========================

Read a token
If it's a ":"
- set compile mode true
- loop
-   read the next token
-   if it's a semicolon set compile mode false and break
-   if it's a colon, error and break
-   else push it on the definition vector
- repeat
- else (we're in execution mode)
-   if it's a number, push it on the stack
-   it it's a word, execute it
- repeat
